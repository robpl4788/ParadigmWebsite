# The Journey
We love to create. Since highschool, we have both spent much of our free time building cool stuff. In 10th grade, looking to push the envelope of what we could make, we purchased a small barebones CNC router. The biggest purchase of our life quickly became the most regrettable one- the machine was unreliable, messy and barely useable. While we got some use out of it with a few upgrades, we were unsatisfied.

### The First Build

Fast forward to 2023- We are both studying engineering at Curtin University in Perth, Australia. Robert works as a machinist, and Kieran as a technician. At this point, the CNC router was unuseable. Given our need for a new machine, and our optimistic naivity as engineering students, we decided that we could do better by building our own from scratch- as such, the "Rooter 1.0" was born. This thing was a beast, improving on our first machine in every aspect. However, in the simplest terms, the Rooter 1.0 was the "Engineers Machine" - Functional, not much else. Safety, Useability and maintainability sat on the sidelines watching on as the machine continued to plough through sheets of aluminium all day long.

### Round Two
The Rooter 1.0 was fun, but it wasn't something you could hit start and walk away from. The next step was User Experience. The kind of machine you can place next to your 3d Printer and have peace of mind for it to create a high quality part without burning the house down. In 2024, we set out to create the "Minirooter". After a year of design iteration, prototyping and testing, we took a step back and realized we had created something awesome.

# The New Paradigm
In recent years, we've seen low-cost 3D printers become more useable than ever, and we see no reason why the same can't be had for CNC machine tools. Our goal is to build machines for the classroom, the makerspace or the apartment. We aim to remove the physical constraints of your projects by unlocking entirely new manufacturing capabilities.

We're only just getting started, but we hope you'll join us on this journey as we continue to develop our flagship product, the Minirooter. With your support, we can look forward to the day where our machines make it's way to desktops across Australia, and around the world.
